Need to get in touch? Want to request some help? Report a problem? Maybe just say hello? Here are your options:

- you can **email the admins** at help@cropdiversity.ac.uk
- or get in touch **via Slack** using https://cropdiversity-hpc.slack.com

Email is best if you need a response from a system administrator, whereas Slack is ideal for more general, community-based support where you can discuss HPC, Linux, bioinformatics, the weather...

The admins
----------

**Iain Milne** - Head of Research Computing, JHI

Iain has been nuts on computers ever since getting access to a BBC Micro in the early 80s. His enthusiasm for them hasn't waned over time, and he now splits his time between all things HPC/Linux and more general software development, concentrating on infomatics visualization and decision support tools.

**Gordon Stephen** - Research Software Engineer, JHI

Gordon has had a strong interest in software development since his first exposure to programming - in True Basic - at the age of 13. Two decades later the interest in programming remains, even if the programming languages have changed. While the main focus of his work is software development and DevOps, recently he's increasingly involved in Linux/HPC administration.
