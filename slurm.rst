Slurm
=====

Cluster jobs are managed using the **Slurm Workload Manager**.  

Slurm is responsible for accepting, scheduling, dispatching, and managing the execution of jobs submitted to the cluster. At the most basic level, you put the commands you want to run into a script file, submit that script to the cluster's queue (of jobs), and Slurm will then select a node for it to run on once it reaches the front of the queue.
