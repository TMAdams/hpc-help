Bioconda
========

Bioconda (https://bioconda.github.io) is a package manager that specializes in providing bioinformatics software, with a repository of over 7,000 packages (as of March 2020) ready to install.

Using Bioconda allows you to pick and choose the software (and versions) that you want without any danger of clashing with anyone else's requirements, and as most packages require nothing more than running ``conda install <packagename>``, the process is incredibly easy.

Follow the instructions below to get up and running with Bioconda in just a few minutes.

.. warning::
  In order to maintain compatibility with the system's backup and data policies, you should not attempt to install Bioconda using any other method than the one listed here.

  
Installing Bioconda
-------------------

To install Bioconda, simply run: ``install-bioconda`` while logged into ``gruffalo``. This will automatically download the necessary files for you, install it to an appropriate area, and then setup the correct channels for finding software for you. By default, it'll install channel information for R, conda-forge, and Bioconda itself.

.. important::
  You must log out and in again (or open a new shell window) before the changes made by the install script will take effect.

You should test that installation was successful::

  $ conda --version
  conda 4.3.27


Finding packages
----------------

There are several options for finding software packages that you can install:

* `browse the package list`_ online to see whatâ€™s available
* use ``conda search <packagename>``

For example::

  $ conda search samtools
  Fetching package metadata .................
  samtools                     1.3                           0  bioconda
                               1.3                           1  bioconda
                               1.3                           2  bioconda
                               1.3.1                         0  bioconda

                               1.3.1                         2  bioconda
                               1.3.1                         3  bioconda
                               1.3.1                         4  bioconda
                               1.3.1                         5  bioconda
                               1.4                           0  bioconda
                               1.4.1                         0  bioconda
                               1.5                           0  bioconda
                               1.5                           1  bioconda
                               1.5                           2  bioconda
                               1.6                           0  bioconda
							   
Once you know the name of the package (and optionally its version), you can query for more information using ``conda info <packagename>`` or ``conda info <packagename>=<version>``::

  $ conda info samtools=1.4
  Fetching package metadata .................
  
  samtools 1.4 0

  file name   : samtools-1.4-0.tar.bz2

  dependencies:
      curl
      libgcc
      xz
      zlib

Importantly, this will tell you what dependencies the package may have, although Bioconda will always resolve these for you automatically.
	  
.. note::
  If you don't specify a version (by using ``<packagename>=<version>``) then Bioconda will assume you're interested in the latest version, which is probably what you want most of the time anyway.


Installing packages
-------------------

To install, use ``conda install <packagename>``. For example::

  $ conda install samtools
  Fetching package metadata .................
  Solving package specifications: .
  
  The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:
  
      bzip2:     1.0.6-1           conda-forge
      curl:      7.54.1-0          conda-forge
      krb5:      1.14.2-0          conda-forge
      libgcc:    7.2.0-h69d50b8_2
      libssh2:   1.8.0-1           conda-forge
      samtools:  1.6-0             bioconda
  
  Proceed ([y]/n)? y

To update an existing package at a later date (eg to its newest version), you can use::

  $ conda update samtools
  
  
Listing packages
----------------

To retrieve a list of installed packages, use::

  $ conda list
  libssh2                   1.8.0                         1    conda-forge
  readline                  6.2                           2
  requests                  2.18.4           py36he2e5f8d_1
  samtools                  1.6                           0    bioconda
  setuptools                36.5.0           py36he42e2e1_0

This returns entries not only for Bioconda, but also for packages from repositories that Bioconda relies upon, such as conda and conda-forge. You can filter the list using::

  $ conda list | grep bioconda

  
Removing packages
-----------------

Removing packages is as simple as::

  $ conda remove samtools
  Fetching package metadata .................
  Solving package specifications: .

  The following packages will be REMOVED:
  
      samtools: 1.6-0 bioconda
  
  Proceed ([y]/n)? y

.. note::
  Removing a package doesn't remove its dependencies, so over time you may find your Bioconda install growing quite large, so run ``conda clean`` to tidy things up.


Environments
------------

While Bioconda is great at resolving package dependencies, it's likely you'll (eventually) find a package you can't install because its dependencies clash with those of already-installed package (which often happens when packages rely on one of the major versions of Python (2 or 3)). Another problematic situation arises if you want to have multiple versions of the same package installed.

Both of these issues can be resolved using environments, which are best thought of as a standalone, isolated working copies of Bioconda.

To use a separate environment, you first need to create it::

  $ conda create -n samtools-old

This environment is isolated from your main Bioconda installation, so you need to activate it before use (note how the command prompt changes when this happens)::

  $ conda activate samtools-old
  (samtools-old) $

You can then proceed to install packages into your new environment::

  (samtools-old) $ conda install samtools=1.4

.. tip::
  You can merge creating a new environment and installing packages into it using just a single command: ``conda create -n samtools-old samtools=1.4``.
  
You can continue to install more packages into this environment if need be, and run scripts and analyses as normal. Once finished with an environment, return to a normal prompt (and your default Bioconda environment) using::

  (samtools-old) $ conda deactivate

Here's how to get a list of all available environments::
  
  $ conda env list
  # conda environments:
  #
  samtools-old             /$APPS/conda/envs/samtools-old
  root                  *  /$APPS/conda

Bioconda refers to your base environment as ``root`` and marks the active one with a ``*``.

If you want to get rid of an environment, make sure it's not active, then run::

  $ conda remove --all -n samtools-old

.. note::
  One school of thought suggests installing every package into its own unique environment. While this certainly avoids any dependency clash problems, it can make things a little awkward if you have pipelines or scripts relying on multiple packages as you're then constantly running ``conda activate`` and ``conda deactivate``. Ultimately though, it's up to you how you set up and manage Bioconda.

  
Removing Bioconda
-----------------

Bioconda is installed in ``$APPS/conda``. Simply delete this folder to remove Bioconda and any additional packages you've installed or environments you've created.


.. _browse the package list: https://bioconda.github.io/conda-recipe_index.html

Using Packages in sbatch jobs scripts
-------------------------------------
When using the ``conda activate`` command in an sbatch job script you may encounter an error mesage::

  CommandNotFoundError: Your shell has not been properly configured to use 'conda activate'.
  
And subsequently when trying to use commands from the package you may get a ``command not found`` error. If this happens change the conda activate command. The required new command depends where you have installed conda. If conda is installed under /mnt/shared/scratch/$USER/apps/conda (where $USER is your username) you would use the following::

  source /mnt/shared/scratch/$USER/apps/conda/bin/activate <environment>
  
where ``<environment>`` is the name of the conda environment you are trying to activate. Alternatively if you installed conda into /home/$USER/miniconda3 you would use::

  source /home/$USER/miniconda3/bin/activate <environment>
  
If the conda bin folder is already in your PATH then simply ``source activate <environment>`` should work.
